The Category Tree
-----------------

Rangespan categorises its product catalog, assigning every item to a category
in a category tree. The category tree contains a number of top-level
categories, below each of which is a tree of subcategories.

For example, an incomplete category tree might look something like this:

    Books
        Fiction
            Adventure
            Drama
            Murder Mystery
        Non-Fiction
            Biography
            History
    Electronics
        Computers
            Components
                Audio cards
                Input Devices
                    Barcode Scanners
                    Mice and Trackballs
                    Scanners
                Motherboards
            Desktops
            Laptops
        Networking
            Bridges
            Routers


Requirements
------------

You are to define a RESTful web service for curating the category tree. It
should store the category tree in an appropriate, persistent data store and
provide the following operations:

::

    add_category(category, parent)

Adds a new category as a direct child of the given parent category.

Example: add_category(‘Science Fiction’, ‘Fiction’) will add Science Fiction as
a new category alongside Adventure, Drama and Murder Mystery.

If parent is omitted, adds a new top-level category

::

    get_subcategories(category)

For the given category, returns a list of its immediate children in the tree.

Example: get_subcategories(‘Books’) returns [‘Fiction’,’Non-Fiction’]

::

    get_lineage(category)

For a given category, retrieve a list showing its ancestry within the
tree.Example: get_lineage(‘Laptops’) returns
[‘Electronics’,’Computers’,’Laptops’]


Technical details
-----------------

1. Code should be in Python 2.7. You are welcome to use all available standard
   libraries, and any open-source third-party libraries of your choice.

2. The code should implement a RESTful web service adhering to the
   requirements above.

3. Return values should be appropriately structured JSON or XML.
